//! Renderer-agnostic core of panel-kit: the panel-workspace state machine.
//!
//! Everything here is pure data and math — no DOM, no terminal, no async.
//! A renderer shell (the Dioxus `panel-kit` crate, the ratatui
//! `panel-kit-tui` crate, or anything else that can draw rectangles and
//! deliver pointer coordinates) owns shared panel state and calls into these
//! contracts:
//!
//! - [`PanelKey`] / [`PanelCatalog`] to identify panels and map them to the
//!   stable string IDs layouts persist,
//! - [`reducer`] for host-owned [`reducer::Snapshot`] state and the pure
//!   [`reducer::reduce`] event path, which delegates to the free functions
//!   below,
//! - [`SurfaceProfile`] / [`effective_mode`] to adapt layout behavior to the
//!   rendered surface,
//! - [`command_for`] / [`apply_command`] for keyboard window management,
//! - [`begin_drag`] / [`begin_tile_resize`] on pointer-down,
//! - [`apply_drag`] on pointer-move,
//! - [`reorder_tile`], [`front_z`], [`restore`] for tiling reorder and
//!   z-order management,
//! - [`effective_rect`] to project stored geometry through the viewport
//!   clamp at render time,
//! - [`StoredLayout`], [`migrate_v1`], [`reconcile_units`], and
//!   [`merge_defaults`] for persistence (renderers supply the actual storage:
//!   localStorage, a JSON file, a KV bucket),
//! - [`views`] for named workspace views: the registry shape and the
//!   storage-key scheme every shell shares, each view holding one
//!   [`SavedLayoutV2`].
//!
//! Units are deliberately abstract: the web shell feeds CSS pixels, the TUI
//! shell feeds character cells. Unit-dependent constants live in
//! [`Clamp`], [`TileMetrics`], and [`CommandStep`].
