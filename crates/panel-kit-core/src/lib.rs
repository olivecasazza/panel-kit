//! Renderer-agnostic core of panel-kit: the panel-workspace state machine.
//!
//! Everything here is pure data and math — no DOM, no terminal, no async.
//! A renderer shell (the Dioxus `panel-kit` crate, the ratatui
//! `panel-kit-tui` crate, or anything else that can draw rectangles and
//! deliver pointer coordinates) owns a `Vec<PanelWin<K>>` plus a `Mode` and
//! an `Option<Drag>`, and calls into these functions:
//!
//! - [`begin_drag`] / [`begin_tile_resize`] on pointer-down,
//! - [`apply_drag`] on pointer-move,
//! - [`reorder_tile`], [`front_z`], [`restore`] for tiling reorder and
//!   z-order management,
//! - [`effective_rect`] to project stored geometry through the viewport
//!   clamp at render time,
//! - [`SavedLayout`] + [`merge_defaults`] for persistence (the shell
//!   supplies the actual storage: localStorage, a JSON file, a KV bucket).
//!
//! Units are deliberately abstract: the web shell feeds CSS pixels, the TUI
//! shell feeds character cells. All unit-dependent constants live in
//! [`Clamp`] and [`TileMetrics`]; [`Clamp::WEB`]/[`TileMetrics::WEB`]
//! preserve the original panel-kit pixel behavior exactly.
