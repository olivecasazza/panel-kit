### BREAKING CHANGES

* 1.0 is a clean cutover to host-owned composition. Git-pinned consumers keep
  their existing revision until their migration branch builds, then update the
  pin; no compatibility facades or deprecated aliases are shipped.
* The web workspace controller, hook, all render/dock methods, and the named
  views controller composite are removed. Applications now own snapshots,
  reducer calls, projection scratch, persistence timing, and Dioxus part
  composition.
* The TUI workspace controller and its render/input/persistence methods are
  removed. Terminal hosts now project through core and draw `panel-kit-tui`
  root, panel, dock, and scrollbar parts explicitly.
* Persistence ports live in `panel_kit_core::persist`: `LayoutStore` now
  includes `clear`, `SavePolicy` owns write timing, and web/TUI stores are
  byte transports only.
* Theme defaults move to `panel_kit_core::theme::ThemeTokens`; web CSS and TUI
  colours are emitted or converted from that source, including focus-ring
  coverage.
* Badge and widget data models move to core, while web and TUI modules retain
  native painters over the shared semantics.
* `mkLayout` remains the unchanged layout-only `SavedLayoutV2` producer. Full
  declarative workspaces use `mkWorkspaceSpec` and the generated schema/parity
  checks.
